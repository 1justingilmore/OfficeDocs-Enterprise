# Designing storage for the Microsoft cloud

 **Summary:** Understand why you need cloud storage and review the list of Microsoft's cloud storage options and the key storage scenarios.
  
Integrating your storage with Microsoft cloud services gives you access to a broad range of services and cloud platform options.
  
## Why cloud storage?

There are two key reasons to use cloud storage.
  
1. Speed to market:
    
  - Faster configuration for high availability and disaster recovery
    
  - No storage hardware to purchase
    
  - Built-in plumbing provided by Microsoft's cloud offerings
    
  - Available from anywhere in the world
    
2. Lower costs to maintain:
    
  - Elasticity to scale up and down your storage demands
    
  - No storage hardware to maintain or migrate
    
  - Microsoft is your built-in plumber to maintain and improve infrastructure
    
  - Best storage security in the marketplace with ongoing improvements
    
## Microsoft cloud storage options

To help you understand the wide variety of cloud storage options, we use a construction analogy.
  
### Move-in ready

Use these prepackaged solutions that are bundled with existing services. Use immediately and with minimal configuration.
  
- Office 365
    
- Microsoft Intune
    
- OneDrive for Business
    
- Dynamics 365
    
- Visual Studio Team Services
    
- Azure Site Recovery
    
- Yammer Site Sharing
    
- Azure Backup
    
For the details of each of these cloud storage options, see [Move-in ready](move-in-ready.md).
  
### Some assembly required

Use these existing services as a starting point for your storage solution with additional configuration or coding for a custom fit.
  
- Azure Content Delivery Network
    
- Azure Media Services
    
- HdInsight
    
- Azure Redis Cache
    
- Azure SQL Database
    
- SQL Server on an Azure VM
    
- Azure Cosmos DB
    
- StorSimple
    
- Azure SQL Data Warehouse
    
- Azure Data Lake Store
    
For the details of each of these cloud storage options, see [Some assembly required](some-assembly-required.md).
  
### Build from the ground up

Use these storage building blocks, along with coding, to create your own storage solution or apps from scratch.
  
- Azure Storage (files)
    
- Azure Storage (blobs)
    
- Azure Storage (queues)
    
- Azure Storage (tables)
    
For the details of each of these cloud storage options, see [Build from the ground up](build-from-the-ground-up.md).
  
## Key storage scenarios

Here are the key scenarios that require cloud-based storage:
  
- Cache data
    
    Accelerate access to commonly used data by storing it in a high-speed cache.
    
- Collaborate with team members
    
    Grant permission to multiple users to allow access to data in cloud storage.
    
- Manage data
    
    Store, move, or delete internal or external bulk data.
    
- Manage source code
    
    Upload, collaborate, and run application code files in the cloud.
    
- Backup files
    
    Store copies of internal or external data offsite in multiple cloud locations.
    
- Publish company communications
    
    Create a single point of publication for internal or external messages.
    
- Distribute millions of events
    
    Create storage for telemetry ingestion from websites, apps, and devices.
    
- Manage/serve videos
    
    Store and serve video content to customers or organization users.
