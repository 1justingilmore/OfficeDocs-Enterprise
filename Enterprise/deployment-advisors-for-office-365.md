# Deployment advisors for Office 365 or Microsoft 365 services

The deployment advisors for Office 365 or Microsoft 365 provide self-guided support for setting up Office 365 for your organization. To access them:

1. Sign in as a tenant administrator in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).
2. Select one of the deployment advisors or guides listed below.

If you don't sign in as a tenant admin, you will eventually see a message that you need to have tenant administrator permissions.

Each advisor is a wizard that guides you through your choices for the features and options you want to deploy. In some cases, you can use the wizard to configure something or activate a setting. Here is an example.

At the end, you'll get links to videos and reference articles. Here is an example.
