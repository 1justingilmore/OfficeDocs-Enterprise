# Deploy Office 365 Enterprise for your organization

Are you ready to deploy Office 365 Enterprise, integrate it with your on-premises infrastructure, and enable your employees to take advantage of cloud-based productivity and collaboration?

This article provides two deployment options, whether you want help or are doing it on your own. In each case, Microsoft provides a guided path for you to follow for deployment success.

## Guided enterprise Office 365 setup process with FastTrack

**[FastTrack for Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/fasttrack/O365-fasttrack-benefit-for-office-365)** is the best method for deploying Office 365. FastTrack guides you through the most common deployment configurations and can answer questions along the way. 

To access a series of setup guides, sign in to your Office 365 subscription, and then go to [Setting up Office 365](https://aka.ms/o365fasttrack).

You can also get help from a [Microsoft partner](https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers/home).

## Self-deployment of Office 365 Enterprise

Deploying Office 365 Enterprise on your own requires planning. Before you begin, make sure you've done the planning needed to glide through the configuration and adoption. Start your planning [here](subscriptions-licenses-accounts-and-tenants-for-microsoft-cloud-offerings.md).

If you want to deploy Office 365 on your own, here are the recommended steps.

1. Set up your network

   Includes adding your Internet domains and optimizing the network performance for your on-premises users. Start [here](set-up-network-for-office-365.md).
 
3. Set up your identities

   Includes determining an identity model (cloud-only or hybrid), and for hybrid identity, setting up directory synchronization between your on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and your Office 365 subscription. Start [here](protect-your-global-administrator-accounts.md).
 
4. Deploy client software

   Includes deploying Office 365 ProPlus, the cloud-updated and always-current version of the Office suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and others) on your devices. Every Office 365 client license includes a license for Office 365 ProPlus. Start [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/deployment-guide-for-office-365-proplus).
 
5. Configure mobile device management

   Office 365 Enterprise includes mobile device management capabilities that help you secure and manage your users' mobile devices. Start [here](https://support.office.com/article/set-up-mobile-device-management-mdm-in-office-365-dd892318-bc44-4eb1-af00-9db5430be3cd).
 
6. Configure services and applications

   Includes information on migration of your data and links to articles that get you started on key Office 365 services such as Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Teams. Start [here](configure-services-and-applications.md).
 
7. Train your users

   Includes short videos that help your users get the most out of Office 365 quickly. Start [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/admin-overview/get-started-with-office-365#training-resources-for-your-users).
