# Hybrid solutions

 **Summary:** Use these articles to deploy Office Server workloads in Microsoft Azure.
  
With Microsoft Azure, you can now deploy some Office Server workloads that were typically deployed on-premises in Azure infrastructure services.
  
For Office 365 identity infrastructure in Azure:
  
- [Connect an on-premises network to a Microsoft Azure virtual network](connect-an-on-premises-network-to-a-microsoft-azure-virtual-network.md)
    
- [Deploy Office 365 Directory Synchronization (DirSync) in Microsoft Azure](deploy-office-365-directory-synchronization-dirsync-in-microsoft-azure.md)
    
- [Deploy high availability federated authentication for Office 365 in Azure](deploy-high-availability-federated-authentication-for-office-365-in-azure.md)
    
For SharePoint Server 2013 workloads in Azure:
  
- [Microsoft Azure Architectures for SharePoint 2013](microsoft-azure-architectures-for-sharepoint-2013.md)
    
- [SharePoint Server 2013 Disaster Recovery in Microsoft Azure](sharepoint-server-2013-disaster-recovery-in-microsoft-azure.md)
