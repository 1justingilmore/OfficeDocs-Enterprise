## Microsoft Cloud Germany transition: Office 365

As we have communicated on August 28, 2019, we are closing the Microsoft Cloud Germany regions, and delivering two new cloud datacenter regions in Germany offering core customer data residency within Germany as well as full connectivity to Microsoft’s global cloud network. These new regions are now live with the general availability of Azure and will offer Office 365, Dynamics 365 and Power Platform which are anticipated to be available in the first quarter of the 2020 calendar year.

## What actions should I take?

By September 30, 2020, migrate to an alternate region. We recommend moving to the new German datacenter regions, or you can choose to migrate to any other region.

We are offering Microsoft-driven migrations to the new German regions.  These new regions will provide core customer data residency within Germany, full connectivity to Microsoft’s global public cloud network backed by robust policies, controls and systems to help customers meet specific compliance and regulatory requirements.

Organizations must opt-in to the migration process by **February 29, 2020**.  Please follow the instructions at [https://aka.ms/office365germanymoveoptin](https://aka.ms/office365germanymoveoptin). 

If you choose not to opt-in for migration, your subscription will expire on September 30, 2020. 

**Please note!** We are updating the terms and conditions to reflect the new subscription expiration date. This will be updated on your next renewal date. <Link/copy of planned text inserted of the new service terms>

## Moving to the new German regions

For organizations who opt-in to the Microsoft-driven approach, migrations are expected to take place March through September 2020. As a result of the migration, core customer data and subscriptions will be moved to the new German regions. Note that after the subscription migration completes, your pricing will decrease to reflect the public cloud pricing <link to pricing page>. Your new subscription will be extended to a new 12-month term, and this will be your new annual renewal date. 

The following services will be migrated as part of the Microsoft-driven approach:

- Azure Active Directory
- Exchange Online
- Exchange Online Protection
- SharePoint Online
- OneDrive for Business
- Skype for Business Online (1)
- Office 365 Groups
- Dynamics / Power Platform (2)

(1) - As part of the migration from Microsoft Cloud Germany to the German region, existing Skype for Business Online customers will transition to Microsoft Teams. Refer to https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeams-Home for more information

(2) - Pre-requisites and impact of migration for these services are described in the < D365 child page (DOCS)> link


## Move Preparation and Experience

Data moves are executed as back-end service operations with minimal interaction required. For customers with more complex configurations, for example firewall restrictions to Microsoft Cloud Germany only or Exchange Hybrid, you will have additional necessary configuration. Such customers must ensure network connectivity to the Office 365 Worldwide service URLs and IP addresses (see https://aka.ms/o365URLs). Additional service specific pre-work will be provided as the transition date approaches including experience for admin and end users throughout the transition. This migration process includes notification to organization administrators to keep you informed on your organization's progress to the German region.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I pick my migration date?**

**A:** No. Unfortunately, we are not able to accommodate specific timing requests. However, the business impact of the migration is limited, and we do not expect this to negatively impact business continuity.

**Q: Once licensing migration is completed, my subscription will extend to a new 12-month term. However, I prefer to subscribe for a shorter period. Can I cancel before the end of the term without paying cancellations fees?**

**A:**

1. Cancelation within 24 hours of new purchase or renewal: Customer gets full money back 
2. Cancelation between 1 day and end of first month of new purchase or renewal: Customer gets prorated money back. Proration is based on purchase price. 
3. Cancelation after 1 month of new purchase or renewal: This is allowed but customer doesn’t get any money back i.e. 100% ETF. This rate can be adjusted by Office by Product/Geo/Segment

**Q: I am not interested in moving to the new German regions, and my subscription ends after September 2020. What will happen to my account on September 30, 2020?**

**A:** Your subscription will expire on September 30, 2020, even if your subscription end date is later. We are updating the Terms and Conditions of all Microsoft Cloud Germany customers to reflect this. <see text>

**Q: I prefer to migrate on my own,  rather than join the Move Program. What should I do?**

**A:** We strongly recommend you join the Move Program for a better migration experience. However, customers interested in migrating on their own can migrate today by following the step by step instructions and instructional videos here. This path is recommended for customers with fewer than 15 seats.

**Q: If I have Azure as well as Office 365, Dynamics 365, and/or Power BI, when can I migrate?**

**A:** Starting in March 2020, when our Office migration tools are available, we’ll be able to support the automated migration of your Office 365 environment as well as the underlying tenant information that is common between Office 365 and Azure. From that point forward, following the Azure migration playbook will be the best reference for Azure migration best practices.

**Q: Will the price change for the Office services that I use?**

**A:** Yes, pricing in Microsoft’s global cloud regions (including the new datacenter regions) is generally lower.
