# Additional Office 365 IP Addresses and URLs not included in the web services

Some network endpoints were previously published and have not been included in the web services. The web services scope is network endpoints that are required for connectivity from an end user of Office 365 across an enterprise perimeter network. This currently does not include:

1. Network connectivity that may be required from a Microsoft datacenter to a customer network (inbound hybrid server network traffic)
2. Network connectivity from servers on a customer network across the enterprise perimeter (outbound server network traffic)
3. Uncommon scenarios for network connectivity requirements from a user
4. DNS resolution connectivity requirement (not listed below)

Apart from DNS, these are all optional for most customers unless you need the specific scenario that is described.
