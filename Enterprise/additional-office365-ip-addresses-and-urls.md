# Additional endpoints not included in the Office 365 IP Address and URL Web service

Some network endpoints were previously published and have not been included in the [Office 365 IP Address and URL Web Service](office-365-ip-web-service.md). The web service scope is network endpoints that are required for connectivity from a user of Office 365 across an enterprise perimeter network. This currently does not include:

1. Network connectivity that may be required from a Microsoft datacenter to a customer network (inbound hybrid server network traffic).
2. Network connectivity from servers on a customer network across the enterprise perimeter (outbound server network traffic).
3. Uncommon scenarios for network connectivity requirements from a user.
4. DNS resolution connectivity requirement (not listed below).
5. Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge Trusted Sites.

Apart from DNS, these are all optional for most customers unless you need the specific scenario that is described.
