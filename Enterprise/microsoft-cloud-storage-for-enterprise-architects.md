# Microsoft Cloud Storage for Enterprise Architects

 **Summary:** Design your storage for Microsoft cloud services and platforms.
  
This article links you to a set of articles that describe what IT architects need to know about designing storage for organizations using Microsoft cloud services and platforms. You can also view this information as a 6-page poster and print it in tabloid format (also known as ledger, 11 x 17, or A3).

You can also see all of the models in the [Microsoft Cloud IT architecture resources](microsoft-cloud-it-architecture-resources.md) and swipe through [Microsoft's Enterprise Cloud Roadmap: Resources for IT Decision Makers](https://aka.ms/cloudarchitecture).
  
See the following sections:
  
- [Designing storage for the Microsoft cloud](designing-storage-for-the-microsoft-cloud.md)
    
    Understand why you should use cloud storage and the key cloud storage scenarios, and then scan the list of the different Microsoft cloud storage options.
    
- [Move-in ready](move-in-ready.md)
    
    Using a construction analogy to organize the wide variety of cloud storage options, these are built-in to other Microsoft cloud offerings and are ready to use immediately.
    
- [Some assembly required](some-assembly-required.md)
    
    These cloud storage options are a starting point for your storage solution, requiring additional configuration or coding for a custom fit.
    
- [Build from the ground up](build-from-the-ground-up.md)
    
    These cloud storage options are the fundamental storage building blocks, which you can use to create your own storage solution or apps from scratch.
