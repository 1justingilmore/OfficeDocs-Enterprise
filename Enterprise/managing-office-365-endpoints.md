description: "Some networks are designed to restrict access to the internet, to ensure computers on networks like these can access Office 365, the network and proxy administrators need to manage the list of FQDNs, URLs, and IP addresses that make up the list of Office 365 endpoints. These need to be added to proxy or firewall rules and PAC files to ensure network requests are able to reach Office 365."

# Managing Office 365 endpoints

## Office 365 network connectivity

 Connections to Office 365 consist of high volume, trusted network requests that perform best when they're made over a low-latency egress that is near the user. Some Office 365 connections can benefit from optimizing the connection. 
  
1. Ensure your firewall allow lists allow for connectivity to Office 365 endpoints.
    
2. Use your proxy infrastructure to allow Internet connectivity to wildcard and unpublished destinations.
    
3. Maintain an optimal perimeter network configuration.
    
4. [Ensure you're getting the best connectivity](https://aka.ms/o365perfprinciples).
    
5. Read [Office 365 Network Connectivity Principles](office-365-network-connectivity-principles.md) to understand the connectivity principles for securely managing Office 365 traffic and getting the best possible performance.

## Update your firewall's outbound allow lists

You can optimize your network by sending all trusted Office 365 network requests directly through your firewall, bypassing all additional packet level inspection or processing. This reduces slow performance from latency and reduces your perimeter capacity requirements. The easiest way to choose which network requests to trust is to use our pre-built PAC files on the **Proxies** tab above. 
  
If your firewall blocks outbound traffic, you'll want to ensure all of the IP and FQDNs listed as **Required** in this [XML file](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=533185) are on the allow list. Recognize all services require the use of some 3rd party services. We don't provide IP addresses for these 3rd party services such as certificate providers, Content Delivery Networks, DNS providers, and so on. For full Office 365 functionality, you must be able to reach all destinations requested by Office 365 regardless of how much information we publish about the destination. 
  
Many destinations do not have an IP address published or are listed as a wildcard domain with no specific fully qualified domain name, to use this functionality you must be able to resolve these network requests to the current IP address being requested and send the network request over the Internet.
  
Automate your process by using a firewall that parses the XML file on your behalf and updates your rules automatically based on the services or features you plan to route directly through your firewall. You can also use the [Azure Range](https://azurerange.azurewebsites.net/) tool that has been built by the community and parses the XML for you with export options for Cisco XE Route or ACL list configuration, plain text, or CSV. 
  
A longer explanation of the network destinations is available on our [reference site](urls-and-ip-address-ranges.md) as well through our [RSS based change log](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=236301) so you can subscribe to changes.

## Configure outbound paths with PAC files

Use PAC or WPAD files to manage network requests that are associated with Office 365 but don't have an IP address provided. Typical network requests that are sent through a proxy or perimeter device incur additional latency. While proxy authentication incurs the largest tax, other services such as reputation lookup and attempts to inspect packets can cause a poor user experience. Additionally, these perimeter network devices need enough capacity to process all of the network requests. We recommend bypassing your proxy or inspection infrastructure for direct Office 365 network requests.
  
Use one of our PAC files as a starting place to determine what network traffic will be sent to a proxy and which will be sent to a firewall. If you're new to PAC or WPAD files, read this post about [deploying PAC files](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/undocumentedfeatures/2016/04/06/deploying-the-office-365-proxy-pac-to-manage-your-users/) from one of our Office 365 consultants. You'll want to review these as a starting place and edit to suit your environment. 
  
 **PAC files updated 7/10/2018**. 
  
### #1 - PAC file: Separates required Internet FQDNs from known Office 365 FQDN.

The first example is a demonstration of our recommended approach to managing endpoints over the Internet only. Bypasses the proxy for Office 365 destinations where the IP address is published and sends remaining network requests to the proxy.
  
Code snippet:
  
```
// JavaScript source code
//July 2018 - Updates go live 1st August2018
//This PAC file contains all FQDNs needed for all services and splits the traffic between those which Microsoft can provide IPs for (so can be sent through a managed firewall with conditional access if desired) and those which IPs cannot be provided for, so need to go to an unrestricted proxy or egress. 
//Due to the use of wildcards, some extra logic is provided to send traffic to the proxy before a 'direct' wildcard is hit.
//Includes Core ProPlus URLs but not Office Mobile/IPAD/IOS/ANDROID fqdns from https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Network-requests-in-Office-365-ProPlus-eb73fcd1-ca88-4d02-a74b-2dd3a9f3364d
//Every Effort is made to ensure 100% accuracy but this PAC should be used as an example and cross-checked with your needs and the Office 365 URL &amp; IP page
//Intended only for Worldwide Office 365 instances, which the vast majority of customers will be using

    var lhost = host.toLowerCase();

### #3 - PAC file: Manage all Office 365 destinations collectively
<a name="bkmk_inet-direct"> </a>

The third example demonstrates sending all network requests associated with Office 365 to a single destination. This is commonly used to bypass all inspection of Office 365 network requests and offers you a format where all published endpoints are in list in the PAC format to use for your customization.
  
Code snippet:
  
```
// JavaScript source code
//July 2018 Update new URLS go live 1st August 2018 -
//Consolidated FQDNs required to access Office 365 - All services including optional components covered and elements covered under wildcards removed. 
//Some repeated domains have been consoliodated into unpublished wildcards in order to keep the file as small as possible.
//Includes Core ProPlus URLs but not Office Mobile/IPAD/IOS/ANDROID fqdns from https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Network-requests-in-Office-365-ProPlus-eb73fcd1-ca88-4d02-a74b-2dd3a9f3364d
//Every Effort is made to ensure 100% accuracy but this PAC should be used as an example and cross-checked with your needs and the Office 365 URL &amp; IP page

Here's a few more tools from the community, if you've built something you'd like to share leave a note in the comments. None of the community tools referenced in this article are officially supported or maintained by Microsoft and are provided here for your convenience.
  
- This is the oldest community generated tool to help manage the process, a tool built by a member of the Office 365 community. Here is link to [download](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Office-365-Proxy-Pac-60fb28f7).

- From Peter Abele: [Download](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/How-to-create-an-up-to-b1fc33f3).
    
- Use your network analysis to determine which network requests should bypass your proxy infrastructure. The most common FQDNs used to bypass customer proxies include the following due to the volume of network traffic sent and received from these endpoints.
    
  ```
  outlook.office365.com
  outlook.office.com
  <tenant-name>.sharepoint.com
  <tenant-name>-my.sharepoint.com
  <tenant-name>-<app>.sharepoint.com
  *.Lync.com
  
  ```

- Ensure any network requests being sent to your firewall directly have a corresponding entry in the firewall allow list to allow the request to go through.
    
## Perimeter network integration
<a name="BKMK_Perimeter"> </a>

Did you know Microsoft's WAN is one of the largest backbones in the world?
  
It's true, this massive network is what makes Office 365 and our other cloud services work regardless of where in the world you are. Our network consists of high bandwidth, low latency, fail-over capable links with thousands of route miles of privately owned dark fiber, and multi-Terabit connections between datacenters and edge nodes, all to make it easier to use our cloud services.
  
With a network like this, you want your organization's devices to connect to our network as soon as possible. With over 2500 ISP peering relationships globally and 70 points of presence, getting from your network to ours should be seamless. It can't hurt to spend a few minutes making sure your ISP's peering relationship is the most optimal, [here's a few examples](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/onthewire/2017/03/22/__) of good and not so good peering hand-offs to our network. 
  
You can manually or automatically configure the devices on your network to optimally handle Office 365 application network requests, depending on your equipment. What configuration changes you need to make to optimally handle Office 365 network traffic will depend on your environment. Office 365 network requests may benefit from network configurations that allow the following:
  
- Priority over less critical network traffic.
    
- Routing to a local egress to avoid backhauling over a slow WAN link while taking advantage of the low latency available on the Microsoft network. [Here's a good discussion](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/onthewire/2017/05/03/office-365-connectivity-guidance-part-2/) based on customer engagements. 
    
- Using DNS near a local egress to ensure the network request that leaves the local egress arrives at the nearest Microsoft peering location.
    
- Exclusion from deep packet inspection or other intensive network packet processing to meet latency requirements at scale.
    
Modern network devices include capabilities to manage network requests for trusted applications such as Office 365 differently than generic, untrusted Internet traffic. With the emerging landscape of SD-WAN solutions, such differentiation of traffic and path selection can also be performed with awareness of the changing state of the network, such as point in time availability, latency or performance of various connectivity paths between the user and the cloud.
  
See [Network and migration planning for Office 365](network-and-migration-planning.md), [Performance troubleshooting plan for Office 365](performance-troubleshooting-plan.md), and [Deployment planning checklist for Office 365](deployment-planning-checklist.md) for additional guidance on planning your network configuration. 
  
### To implement this scenario:

Check with your network solution or service provider if they can use Office 365 URL and IP definitions from XML to facilitate local (to the user), low overhead network egress for Office 365 traffic, manage its priority relative to other applications and adjust the network path for Office 365 connections into Microsoft network depending on changing network conditions. Some solutions download and automate Office 365 URL and IP XMLs definition in their stacks.
  
Always ensure that the implemented solution has necessary degree of resiliency, appropriate geo-redundancy of the network path for Office 365 traffic and accommodates changes to Office 365 URLs and IPs as they become published.
  
## Web service
<a name="webservice"> </a>

To help you better identify and differentiate Office 365 network traffic, a new web service publishes Office 365 endpoints, making it easier for you to evaluate, configure, and stay up to date with changes. This new web service (now in preview), will eventually replace the lists of endpoints in the [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](urls-and-ip-address-ranges.md) article, along with the RSS and XML versions of that data. These format of endpoint data are planned to be phased out on October 2, 2018. 
  
As a customer or a network perimeter device vendor, you can build against the new REST-based web service for the Office 365 IP address and FQDN entries.
  
- For the latest version of the Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges, use [https://endpoints.office.com/version](https://endpoints.office.com/version?clientrequestid=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7).
    
- For the data on the Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges page for firewalls and proxy servers, use [https://endpoints.office.com/endpoints/worldwide](https://endpoints.office.com/endpoints/worldwide?clientrequestid=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7).
    
- To get the latest changes, use [https://endpoints.office.com/changes/worldwide/0000000000](https://endpoints.office.com/changes/worldwide/0000000000?clientrequestid=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7).
    
As a customer, you can use this web service to: 
  
- Update your PowerShell scripts to obtain Office 365 endpoint data and modify any formatting for your networking devices.
    
- Use this information to update PAC files deployed to client computers.
    
As a network perimeter device vendor, you can use this web service to: 
  
- Create and test device software to download the list for automated configuration. 
    
- Check for the current version.
    
- Get the current changes.
    
The following sections describe the preview of this web service, which might change over time until the service is generally available. 
  
The data on the web service is up to date and we are not planning to make further changes to the web service URLs or returned data schema before the general availability release of this web service.
  
For additional information, see:
  
- [Announcement blog post in the Office 365 Tech Community Forum](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-365-Blog/Announcing-Office-365-endpoint-categories-and-Office-365-IP/ba-p/177638)
    
- [Office 365 Tech Community Forum for questions about use of the web services](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-365-Networking/bd-p/Office365Networking)
    
### Common parameters

These parameters are common across all the web service methods:
  
- **format=CSV | JSON** - Query string parameter. By default, the returned data format is JSON. Include this optional parameter to return the data in comma-separated values (CSV) format. 
    
- **ClientRequestId** - Query string parameter. A required GUID that you generate for client session association. You should generate a GUID for each client machine that calls the web service. Do not use the GUIDs shown in the following examples because they may be blocked by the web service in the future. GUID format is xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx, where x represents a hexadecimal number. To generate a GUID, use the [New-Guid](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/new-guid?view=powershell-6) PowerShell command. 
    
### Version web method

Microsoft updates the Office 365 IP address and FQDN entries at the end of each month and occasionally out of cycle for operational or support requirements. The data for each published instance is assigned a version number. The version web method lets you poll for the latest version for each Office 365 service instance. We recommend you check the version daily, or at the most, hourly.
  
There is one parameter for the version web method:
  
- **AllVersions=true** - Query string parameter. By default, the version returned is the latest. Include this optional parameter to request all published versions. 
    
- **Instance** - Route parameter. This optional parameter specifies the instance to return the version for. If omitted, all instances are returned. Valid instances are: Worldwide, China, Germany, USGovDoD, USGovGCCHigh 
    
The result from the version web method may be a single record or an array of records. The elements of each record are:
  
- instance - The short name of the Office 365 service instance.
    
- latest - The latest version for endpoints of the specified instance.
    
- versions - A list of all previous versions for the specified instance. This element is only included if the AllVersions parameter is true.
   
#### Examples:
  
Example 1 request URI: **<span>https:</span>//endpoints.office.com/version?ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7**
  
This URI returns the latest version of each Office 365 service instance. Example result:
  
```
[
 {
  "instance": "Worldwide", 
  "latest": "2018063000"
 },
 {
  "instance": "USGovDoD",

] 
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The GUID for the ClientRequestID parameter in these URIs are only an example. To try the web service URIs out, generate your own GUID. The GUIDs shown in these examples may be blocked by the web service in the future. 
  
Example 2 request URI: **<span>https:</span>//endpoints.office.com/version/Worldwide?ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7**
  
This URI returns the latest version of the specified Office 365 service instance. Example result:
  
```
{
 "instance": "Worldwide",
 "latest": "2018063000"
}
```

Example 3 request URI: **<span>https:</span>//endpoints.office.com/version/Worldwide?Format=CSV&amp;ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7**
  
This URI shows output in CSV format. Example result:
  
```
instance,latest
Worldwide,2018063000
```

Example 4 request URI: **<span>https:</span>//endpoints.office.com/version/Worldwide?AllVersions=true&amp;ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7**
  
This URI shows all prior versions that have been published for the Office 365 worldwide service instance. Example result:
  
```
{
  "instance": "Worldwide",
  "latest": "2018063000",
  "versions": [
    "2018063000",
    "2018062000"
  ]
}
```

### Endpoints web method

The endpoints web method returns all records for IP address ranges and URLs that make up the Office 365 service. Parameters for the endpoints web method are:
  
- **ServiceAreas** - Query string parameter. A comma-separated list of service areas. Valid items are Common,Exchange,SharePoint,Skype. Because Common service area items are a prerequisite for all other service areas, the web service will always include them. If you do not include this parameter, all service areas are returned. 
    
- **TenantName** - Query string parameter. Your Office 365 tenant name. The web service takes your provided name and inserts it in parts of URLs that include the tenant name. If you don't provide a tenant name, those parts of URLs have the wildcard character (\*). 
    
- **NoIPv6** - Query string parameter. Set this to true to exclude IPv6 addresses from the output, for example, if you don't use IPv6 in your network. 
    
- **Instance** - Route parameter. This required parameter specifies the instance to return the endpoints for. Valid instances are: Worldwide, China, Germany, USGovDoD, USGovGCCHigh. 
    
The result from the endpoints web method is an array of records with each record representing an endpoint set. The elements for each record are:
  
- id - The immutable id number of the endpoint set.
    
- serviceArea - The service area that this is part of: Common, Exchange, SharePoint, or Skype.
    
- urls - URLs for the endpoint set. A JSON array of DNS records. Omitted if blank.
    
- tcpPorts - TCP ports for the endpoint set. All ports elements are formatted as a comma-separated list of ports or port ranges separated by a dash character (-). Ports apply to all IP addresses and all URLs in that endpoint set for that category. Omitted if blank.
    
- udpPorts - UDP ports for the IP address ranges in this endpoint set. Omitted if blank.
    
- ips - The IP address ranges associated with this endpoint set as associated with the listed TCP or UDP ports. Omitted if blank.
    
- category - The connectivity category for the endpoint set. Valid values are Optimize, Allow, and Default. Required.
    
- expressRoute - True or False if this endpoint set is routed over ExpressRoute.
    
- required - True if this endpoint set is required to have connectivity for Office 365 to be supported. Omitted if false.
    
- notes - For optional endpoints, this text describes Office 365 functionality that will be missing if IP addresses or URLs in this endpoint set cannot be accessed at the network layer. Omitted if blank.
    
#### Examples:
  
Example 1 request URI: **<span>https:</span>//endpoints.office.com/endpoints/Worldwide?ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7**
  
This URI obtains all endpoints for the Office 365 worldwide instance for all workloads. Example result showing an excerpt of the output:
  
```
[ 
 { 
  "id": 1, 
  "serviceArea": "Exchange", 
  "serviceAreaDisplayName": "Exchange Online", 
  "urls": 
   [ 
    "*.protection.outlook.com" 
   ], 
  "ips": 
   [ 
    "2a01:111:f403::/48", "23.103.132.0/22", "23.103.136.0/21", "23.103.198.0/23", "23.103.212.0/22", "40.92.0.0/14", "40.107.0.0/17", "40.107.128.0/18", "52.100.0.0/14", "213.199.154.0/24", "213.199.180.128/26", "94.245.120.64/26", "207.46.163.0/24", "65.55.88.0/24", "216.32.180.0/23", "23.103.144.0/20", "65.55.169.0/24", "207.46.100.0/24", "2a01:111:f400:7c00::/54", "157.56.110.0/23", "23.103.200.0/22", "104.47.0.0/17", "2a01:111:f400:fc00::/54", "157.55.234.0/24", "157.56.112.0/24", "52.238.78.88/32" 
   ], 
  "tcpPorts": "443", 
  "expressRoute": true, 
  "category": "Allow" 
 }, 
 { 
  "id": 2, 
  "serviceArea": "Exchange", 
  "serviceAreaDisplayName": "Exchange Online", 
  "urls": 
   [ 
    "*.mail.protection.outlook.com" 
   ],
...
```

Additional endpoint sets are not included in this example.
  
Example 2 request URI: **<span>https:</span>//endpoints.office.com/endpoints/Worldwide?ServiceAreas=Exchange&amp;ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7**
  
This example obtains endpoints for the Office 365 Worldwide instance for Exchange Online and dependencies only.
  
The output for example 2 is similar to example 1 except that the results will not include endpoints for SharePoint Online or Skype for Business Online.
  
### Changes web method

The changes web method returns the most recent updates that have been published. This is typically the previous month's changes to IP address ranges and URLs.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Data from the changes API is accurate in the preview and should be used for development and testing only. 
  
The parameter for the changes web method is:
  
- **Version** - Required URL route parameter. The version that you have currently implemented, and you want to see the changes since that version. The format is YYYYMMDDNN. 
    
The result from the changes web method is an array of records with each record representing a change in a specific version of the endpoints. The elements for each record are:
  
- id - The immutable id of the change record.
    
- endpointSetId - The ID of the endpoint set record that is changed. Required.
    
- disposition - This can be either of change, add, or remove and describes what the change did to the endpoint set record.
    
- version - The version of the published endpoint set in which the change was introduced. Version numbers are of the format YYYYMMDDNN, where NN is a natural number incremented if there are multiple versions required to be published on a single day.
    
- previous - A substructure detailing previous values of changed elements on the endpoint set. This will not be included for newly added endpoint sets. Includes tcpPorts, udpPorts, ExpressRoute, category, required, notes.
    
- current - A substructure detailing updated values of changes elements on the endpoinset. Includes tcpPorts, udpPorts, ExpressRoute, category, required, notes.
    
- add - A sub structure detailing items to be added to endpoint set collections. Omitted if there are no additions.
    
  - effectiveDate - Defines the data when the additions will be live in the service.
    
  - ips - Items to be added to the ips array.
    
  - urls- Items to be added to the urls array.
    
- remove - A substructure detailing items to be removed from the endpoint set. Omitted if there are no removals.
    
  - ips - Items to be removed from the ips array.
    
  - urls- Items to be removed from the urls array.
    
 **Examples:**
  
Example 1 request URI: **<span>https:</span>//endpoints.office.com/changes/worldwide/0000000000?ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7**
  
This requests all previous changes to the Office 365 worldwide service instance. Example result:
  
```
[ 
 { 
  "id": 424, 
  "endpointSetId": 32, 
  "disposition": "Change", 
  "version": "2018062700",

This requests changes since the specified version to the Office 365 Worldwide instance. In this case, the version specified is the latest. Example result:
  
```
[
  {
    "id":3,
    "endpointSetId":33,
    "changeDescription":"Removing old IP prefixes",

Here is a PowerShell script that you can run to see if there are actions you need to take for updated data. This script checks the version number for the Office 365 Worldwide instance endpoints. When there is a change, it downloads the endpoints and filters for the "Allow" and "Optimize" category endpoints. It also uses a unique ClientRequestId across multiple calls and saves the latest version found in a temporary file. You should call this script once an hour to check for a version update.
  
```
# webservice root URL
$ws = "https://endpoints.office.com"
# path where client ID and latest version number will be stored
$datapath = $Env:TEMP + "\endpoints_clientid_latestversion.txt"
# fetch client ID and version if data file exists; otherwise create new file
if (Test-Path $datapath) {
    $content = Get-Content $datapath
    $clientRequestId = $content[0]
    $lastVersion = $content[1]
}
else {
    $clientRequestId = [GUID]::NewGuid().Guid
    $lastVersion = "0000000000"
    @($clientRequestId, $lastVersion) | Out-File $datapath

### Web Service interface versioning

Updates to the parameters or results for these web service methods may be required in the future. After the general availability version of these web services is published, Microsoft will make reasonable efforts to provide advance notice of material updates to the web service. When Microsoft believes that an update will require changes to clients using the web service, Microsoft will keep the previous version (one version back) of the web service available for at least twelve (12) months after the release of the new version. Customers who do not upgrade during that time may be unable to access the web service and its methods. Customers must ensure that clients of the web service continue working without error if the following changes are made to the web service interface signature:
  
- Adding a new optional parameter to an existing web method that doesn't have to be provided by older clients and doesn't impact the result an older client receives.
    
- Adding a new named attribute in one of the response REST items or additional columns to the response CSV.
    
- Adding a new web method with a new name that is not called by the older clients.
    
## FAQ

Frequently-asked administrator questions about connectivity:
  
### How do I submit a question?

Click the link at the bottom to indicate if the article was helpful or not and submit any additional questions. We monitor the feedback and update the questions here with the most frequently asked.
  
### When is the XML file updated?

When new endpoints are announced, there is usually a 30+ day buffer before they are effective and network requests begin going to them. This buffer is to ensure customers and partners have an opportunity to update their systems. FQDN and IP prefix additions and removals are processed in the XML file at the same time as the announcement, meaning a new FQDN will be in the XML file 30 days before use. Since we stop sending network requests to endpoints we're removing prior to announcing their removal, when we remove the endpoint from the XML at the same time as the announcement it is already unused.
  
### How can I be notified of changes?
<a name="bkmk_changes"> </a>

Office 365 endpoints are published at the end of each month with 30 days notice. Occasionally changes will occur more than once a month or with shorter notice periods. When an endpoint is added, the effective date listed in the [RSS feed](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=236301) is the date after which network requests will be sent to the endpoint. If you're new to RSS, here is how to [subscribe via Outlook](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=532416) or you can [have the RSS feed updates emailed to you](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=532417).
  
### How do I read the RSS change log?
<a name="bkmk_changes"> </a>

After you subscribe to the RSS feed, you can parse the information yourself or with a script. The following table describes the format of the RSS feed o make it easier.
  
|**Section**|**Part 1**|**Part 2**|**Part 3**|**Part 4**|**Part 5**|**Part 6**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**Description** <br/> |Count  <br/> |Date after which you can expect network requests to be sent to the endpoint.  <br/> |Basic description of the feature or service that requires the endpoint.  <br/> |Can you connect to this endpoint on an ExpressRoute Circuit in addition to the internet?  <br/> |**Yes** - you can connect to this endpoint on both the internet and ExpressRoute.  <br/> **No** - you can only connect to this endpoint on the internet.  <br/> |The destination FQDN or IP range being added or removed.  <br/> |
|**Example** <br/> |1/  <br/> |[Effective xx/xx/xxx.  <br/> |Required: \<description\>.  <br/> |ExpressRoute:  <br/> |\<Yes/No\>.  <br/> |\<FQDN/IP\>],  <br/> |
   
A couple other things to note, every entry has a common set of delimiters:
  
- **/** - after the count 
    
- **[** - to indicate the entry for the count 
    
- **.** - used in between each distinct section of the entry 
    
- **],** - to indicate the end of a single entry 
    
- **].** - To indicate the end of all the entries 
    
### How do I determine the location of my tenant?

 **Tenant location** is best determined using our [datacenter map](https://o365datacentermap.azurewebsites.net/).
  
### Am I peering appropriately with Microsoft?

 **Peering locations** are described in more detail in [peering with Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/peering).
  
With over 2500 ISP peering relationships globally and 70 points of presence, getting from your network to ours should be seamless. It can't hurt to spend a few minutes making sure your ISP's peering relationship is the most optimal, [here's a few examples](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/onthewire/2017/03/22/__) of good and not so good peering hand-offs to our network. 
  
### How do I determine which IP addresses to accept over ExpressRoute?

 **Accepted ExpressRoute routes** are defined by [Microsoft's IP ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53602) and the specific Office 365 [BGP communities](https://support.office.com/article/Using-BGP-communities-in-ExpressRoute-for-Office-365-scenarios-preview-9ac4d7d4-d9f8-40a8-8c78-2a6d7fe96099).
  
### How do I determine which endpoints I need?

We regularly add new features and services to the Office 365 suite, expanding the connectivity landscape. If you're subscribed to the E3 or E5 SKU, the simple way to think about the list of endpoints is that you need all of them to get full functionality for the suite. If you aren't subscribed to either of these SKUs the difference is minimal in terms of the number of endpoints.
  
Read [Office 365 Network Connectivity Principles](office-365-network-connectivity-principles.md) to get more information on Office 365 endpoint categories, and to understand the connectivity principles for securely managing Office 365 traffic and getting the best possible performance. 
  
In the image below, you can see an example from a portion of the FQDN table in the Office Online section. The rows are organized by feature and differences in connectivity. The first two rows indicate Office Online relies on the endpoints marked Required in the Office 365 Authentication and Identity and portal and shared sections. This is typical for a service within Office 365 to rely on these shared services. The third row indicates client computers must be able to reach \*.officeapps.live.com to use Office Online and the fourth row indicates computers must also be able to reach \*.cdn.office.net to use Office Online.
  
Even though both row three and four are required to use Office Online, they've been separated to indicate the destination is different:
  
1. \*.officeapps.live.com does not represent a CDN, meaning requests to this namespace will go directly to a Microsoft datacenter.
    
2. \*.officeapps.live.com is accessible on ExpressRoute circuits using Microsoft Peering.
    
3. The IP addresses associated with Office Online and \*.officeapps.live.com can be found by following this link.
    
4. \*.cdn.office.net represents a CDN hosted by Akamai, meaning requests to this namespace will go to an Akamai datacenter.
    
5. \*.cdn.office.net is not accessible on ExpressRoute circuits.
    
6. The IP addresses associated with Office Online and \*.cdn.office.net are not available.

### I see network requests to IP addresses not on the published list, do I need to provide access to them?
<a name="bkmk_MissingIP"> </a>

We only provide IP addresses for the Office 365 servers you should route directly to over the Internet or ExpressRoute. This isn't a comprehensive list of all IP addresses you'll see network requests for. You'll see network requests to Microsoft and third-party owned, unpublished, IP addresses. These IP addresses are dynamically generated or managed in a way that prevents timely notice when they change. If your firewall can't allow access based on the FQDNs for these network requests, use a PAC or WPAD file to manage the requests.
  
See an IP associated with Office 365 that you want more information on?
  
1. Check if the IP address is included in a larger published range using a [CIDR calculator](http://jodies.de/ipcalc).
    
2. See if a partner owns the IP with a [whois query](https://dnsquery.org/). If it's Microsoft owned, it may be an internal partner.
    
3. Check the certificate, in a browser connect to the IP address using  *HTTPS://\<IP_ADDRESS\>*  , check the domains listed on the certificate to understand what domains are associated with the IP address. If it's a Microsoft owned IP address and not on the list of Office 365 IP addresses, it's likely the IP address is associated with a Microsoft CDN such as  *MSOCDN.NET*  or another Microsoft domain without published IP information. If you do find the domain on the certificate is one where we claim to list the IP address, please let us know. 
    
### Why do I see names such as nsatc.net or akadns.net in the Microsoft domain names?
<a name="bkmk_akamai"> </a>

Office 365 and other Microsoft services use several third-party services such as Akamai and MarkMonitor to improve your Office 365 experience. To keep giving you the best experience possible, we may change these services in the future. In doing so, we often publish the CNAME record which points to a third party owned domain, A record, or IP address. Third party domains may host content, such as a CDN, or they may host a service, such as a geographical traffic management service. When you see connections to these third parties, they're in the form of a redirect or referral, not an initial request from the client. Some customers need to ensure this form of referral and redirection is allowed to pass without explicitly adding the long list of potential FQDNs third party services may use.
  
The list of services is subject to change at any time. Some of the services currently in use include:
  
[MarkMonitor](https://www.markmonitor.com/) is in use when you see requests that include  *\*.nsatc.net*  . This service provides domain name protection and monitoring to protect against malicious behavior. 
  
[ExactTarget](https://www.marketingcloud.com/) is in use when you see requests to  *\*.exacttarget.com*  . This service provides email link management and monitoring against malicious behavior. 
  
[Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/) is in use when you see requests that include one of the following FQDNs. This service offers geo-DNS and content delivery network services. 
  
```
*.akadns.net
*.akam.net
*.akamai.com
*.akamai.net
*.akamaiedge.net
*.akamaihd.net
*.akamaized.net
*.edgekey.net
*.edgesuite.net

```

### What are the three types of Office 365 endpoints?
<a name="bkmk_akamai"> </a>

- You connect to third-party services to retrieve basic internet services such as DNS lookups and CDN content retrieval. You also connect to third-party services for integrations such as incorporating YouTube videos in your OneNote notebooks.
    
- You connect to secondary services hosted and run by Microsoft such as edge nodes that enable your network request to enter Microsoft's global network at the closest internet location to your computer. As the third largest network on the planet, this improves your connectivity experience. You also connect to Microsoft Azure services such as Azure Media Services which are used by a variety of Office 365 services.
    
- You connect to primary Office 365 services such as the Exchange Online mailbox server or the Skype for Business Online server where your unique and proprietary data lives. You can connect to the primary Office 365 services by FQDN or IP address and use internet or ExpressRoute circuits. You can only connect to the third party and secondary services using FQDNs on an internet circuit.
    
The following diagram shows the differences between these service areas. In this diagram, the customer on-premises network in the lower left has multiple network devices to assist in managing network connectivity. Configurations like this one are common for enterprise customers. If your network only has a firewall between your client computers and the internet, that's supported as well, and you'll want to ensure your firewall can support FQDNs and wildcards in the allow list rules.
  
Read [Office 365 Network Connectivity Principles](office-365-network-connectivity-principles.md) to get more information on Office 365 endpoint categories, and to understand the connectivity principles for securely managing Office 365 traffic and getting the best possible performance. 
  
![Shows the three different types of network endpoints when using Office 365](media/6582bcfa-11ba-4ac2-9b69-14bef0437670.png)
  
### I can't or don't want to use any third-party service
<a name="bkmk_thirdparty"> </a>

Office 365 is a suite of services built to function over the internet, the reliability and availability promises are based on many standard internet services being available. For example, standard internet services such as DNS, CRL, and CDNs must be reachable to use Office 365 just as they must be reachable to use most modern internet services.
  
In addition to these basic internet services, there are third-party services that are only used to integrate functionality. For example, using Giphy.com within Microsoft Teams allows customers to seamlessly include Gifs within Teams. Similarly, YouTube and Flickr are third-party services that are used to seamlessly integrate video and images into Office clients from the internet. While these are needed for integration, they're marked as optional in the Office 365 endpoints article which means core functionality of the service will continue to function if the endpoint isn't accessible.
  
If you're attempting to use Office 365 and are finding third party services aren't accessible you'll want to [ensure all FQDNs marked required or optional in this article are allowed through the proxy and firewall](urls-and-ip-address-ranges.md).
  
### I can't or don't want to use any secondary services
<a name="bkmk_secondary"> </a>

Secondary services are Microsoft services that don't fall within Office 365 control. These are things like the edge network, Azure Media Services, and Azure Content Delivery Networks. These are all required to use Office 365 and must be reachable.
  
If you're attempting to use Office 365 and are finding third party services aren't accessible you'll want to [ensure all FQDNs marked required or optional in this article are allowed through the proxy and firewall](urls-and-ip-address-ranges.md).
  
### How do I block access to Microsoft's consumer services?
<a name="bkmk_consumer"> </a>

Restricting access to our consumer services should be done at your own risk, the only reliable way to block consumer services is to restrict access to the  *login.live.com*  FQDN. This FQDN is used by a broad set of services including non-consumer services such as MSDN, TechNet, and others. Restricting access to this FQDN may result in the need to also include exceptions to the rule for network requests associated with these services. 
  
Keep in mind that blocking access to the Microsoft consumer services alone won't prevent the ability for someone on your network to exfiltrate information using an Office 365 tenant or other service.
