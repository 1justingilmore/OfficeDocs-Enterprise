# Where your customer data is stored in Office 365 datacenters

The tables in this article show where customer data is stored at-rest for Office 365 services across all of Microsoft’s global cloud Geos. Click your country name in the list on the right to find out where customer data for each service is being stored.
 
You can also view tenant-specific data location information in your Office 365 Admin Center. Go to **Settings > Organization profile > Data location > View details**.

## FAQ

### How does Microsoft define data? 

Review our definitions for different types of data on the Microsoft Trust Center. In the Microsoft Online Services Terms, Microsoft makes contractual commitments regarding customer data/your data. We refer to core customer data as the customer data that is committed to be stored at rest only within your region according to the Microsoft Online Services Terms.


### Where are the exact addresses of the data centers? 

Microsoft does not disclose the exact addresses of its data centers. We established this policy to help secure our data center facilities.


### Does the location of your customer data have a direct impact on your end users’ experience? 

The performance of Office 365 is not simply proportional to a user’s distance to data center locations. Microsoft’s continued investments in its global cloud network, global cloud infrastructure, and the Office 365 services architecture help provide users with a singular, consistent experience independent of where customer data is stored at rest. If your users are experiencing performance issues, you should troubleshoot those in depth. Microsoft has published guidance for Office 365 customers to plan for and optimize end-user performance on the Office Support web site.


### How does Microsoft help me comply with my national, regional, and industry-specific regulations? 

To help you comply with national, regional, and industry-specific requirements governing the collection and use of individuals’ data, Office 365 offers the most comprehensive set of compliance offerings of any global cloud productivity provider. Please review our compliance offerings and more details in the Office 365 Compliance section on the Microsoft Trust Center. Also, certain Office 365 plans offer further compliance solutions to help you manage your data, comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and monitor actions taken on your data.


### Who can access your data and according to what rules? 

Microsoft implements strong measures to help protect your customer data from inappropriate access or use by unauthorized persons. This includes restricting access by Microsoft personnel and subcontractors, and carefully defining requirements for responding to government requests for customer data. However, you can access your own customer data at any time and for any reason. More details are available on the Microsoft Trust Center.


### Does Microsoft access your data? 

Microsoft automates most Office 365 operations while intentionally limiting its own access to customer data. This helps us manage Office 365 at scale and address the risks of internal threats to customer data. By default, Microsoft engineers have no standing administrative privileges and no standing access to customer data in Office 365. A Microsoft engineer may have limited and logged access to customer data for a limited amount of time, but only when necessary for normal service operations and only when approved by a member of senior management at Microsoft (and, for customers who are licensed for the Customer Lockbox feature, by the customer).


### How does Microsoft secure your data? 

Microsoft has robust policies, controls, and systems built into Office 365 to help keep your information safe. Review the Office 365 security section on the Microsoft Trust Center to learn more.


### Does Office 365 encrypt your data? 

Office 365 uses service-side technologies that encrypt customer data at rest and in transit. For customer data at rest, Office 365 uses volume-level and file-level encryption. For customer data in transit, Office 365 uses multiple encryption technologies for communications between data centers and between clients and servers, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). Office 365 also includes customer-managed encryption features.


### Where can I find data residency information for Microsoft Azure? 

Please review the Products available by region page to find data residency information for Microsoft Azure.


### What are Multi-Geo Capabilities in Office 365? 

Multi-Geo enables a single Office 365 tenant to span across multiple Office 365 data center regions and gives customers the ability to store their Office 365 core customer data, on a per-user basis, in select regions.


### What services support Multi-Geo? 

Multi-Geo is available for Exchange Online and OneDrive. Microsoft is investigating Multi-Geo for other Office 365 services.
