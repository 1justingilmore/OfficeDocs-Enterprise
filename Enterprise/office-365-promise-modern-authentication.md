# Office 365 Client Capabilities - Modern Authentication

Microsoft’s Modern Authentication capability enables several scenarios for your enterprise customers to authenticate with Office 365 support rich applications and a variety of administrative tools, including:

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** - a method of computer access control in which a user is granted access only after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism – typically at least two of the following categories: knowledge (something they know), possession (something they have), and inherence (something they are). Learn more about [multi-factor authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/multi-factor-authentication).
- **Certificate-Based Authentication (CBA)** - uses a digital certificate to identify a user, machine, or device before granting access to a resource, network, application, etc. In the case of user authentication, it is often deployed in coordination with traditional methods such as username and password. One differentiator of certificate-based authentication is that unlike some solutions that only work for users, such as biometrics and one time passwords (OTP), the same solution can be used for all endpoints – users, machine, devices and even the growing Internet of Things (IoT).
