# Plan your upgrade from Office 2007 or Office 2010 servers and clients

If your organization is using older versions of Office products and servers, this is a great time to start planning your upgrade. Office 2007 products and services have reached their end of support, and Office 2010 products and services are nearing their end of support. 

Use the resources in this section to get started.

- [Upgrading from Office 2010 servers and clients](upgrade-from-office-2010-servers-and-products.md)

- [Upgrading from Office 2007 servers and clients](upgrade-from-office-2007-servers-and-products.md)

## What upgrade options are available?      

Organizations have several options to consider:

- **Move to Microsoft 365**: For many customers, moving to the cloud is an efficient and cost-effective solution. Setup and maintenance are easier, and you get all the latest features and security updates. To learn more, see the [What is Microsoft 365?](#what-is-microsoft-365) section in this article.
    
- **Upgrade your on-premises servers and applications.** See the [Office](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/office-2010-end-support-roadmap), [Exchange](exchange-2010-end-of-support.md),  [SharePoint](upgrade-from-sharepoint-2010.md), [Project Server and Project Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/project/planning-project-server-and-project-online-for-technical-decision-makers), and [Skype for Business](https://docs.microsoft.com/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/upgrade) planning content. 
    
- **Implement a hybrid solution including Office 365** and your on-premises servers and applications. See [Office 365 hybrid cloud solutions overview.](https://support.office.com/article/59616fab-acdb-40e9-b414-cf0c965c80b7.aspx)
    
### Help is available for your organization

We recommend getting help with planning your upgrade.

- Consider working with a partner or volume licensing specialist. **[Find your Office 365 partner or reseller](https://support.office.com/article/b6c18a9b-2aed-4c84-9d75-af709160258c.aspx)**. 

- If your organization purchases a certain number of Microsoft cloud licenses, our FastTrack team can help you through the setup process. To learn more, visit [FastTrack](https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack).

- If you're part of a smaller organization or you want to handle the upgrade yourself, see [Admins: upgrade your users to the latest Office client using Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/article/f6b00895-b5fd-4af6-a656-b7788ea20cbb.aspx). 
  
## I'm a home user. What do I do?

If you're using Office 2007 or Office 2010 at home, consider the following options:

- **Try Office 365 for home use**. Choose between an [Office 365 Home](https://www.microsoft.com/p/office-365-home/cfq7ttc0k5dm) or [Office 365 Personal](https://www.microsoft.com/p/office-365-personal/cfq7ttc0k5bf) subscription. and sign up for a trial. Sign up, and install the latest version of Office on your Windows or Mac computer, your iOS or Android smartphone, and your iOS or Android tablet. With Office 365, you'll enjoy cloud storage with OneDrive, you'll get 60 minutes of Skype calls to mobile and landline numbers each month, and you'll get many other great features. [See Office 365 plans and pricing for home](https://products.office.com/explore-office-for-home).
    
- **Purchase Office Home &amp; Student 2016**. If you choose this option, you'll make a one-time purchase and then install Office 2016 on your [Windows PC](https://www.microsoft.com/p/office-home-student-2016-for-pc/cfq7ttc0k5fc) or [Mac](https://products.office.com/buy/compare-microsoft-office-products-for-mac). 


## What happens if I don't upgrade?

You can choose not to upgrade at this time. Your on-premises servers and applications will continue to run. However, when you no longer receive security updates or support options, you or your organization could be vulnerable to security breaches. We strongly recommend that you plan your upgrade as soon as possible, whether to Office 365 or to newer versions of your on-premises servers and applications.
   
## What is Microsoft 365?

Microsoft 365 is the combination of Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) that provides a complete, intelligent solution to empower everyone to be creative and work together, securely. 
  
Although you can migrate your Office 2007 or Office 2010 servers and clients to Office 365, Microsoft 365 includes the licenses and capabilities to ensure that your organization is working on the latest Windows operating system and that your devices—including Windows, iOS, and Android—are enrolled and kept secure with policies that require authentication and data protection. In addition, Windows 10 and your Office 365 client software is updated on a continuing basis to include the latest features and security updates.
  
Microsoft 365 is the way to digitally transform your business with constantly-improving devices and productivity experiences, enabled and secured by the Microsoft cloud.
