Office 365 requires internet connectivity from every computer connecting to the service. This article serves as a reference for the specific Microsoft and third-party endpoints computers need to be able to reach. Start with our [managing Office 365 endpoints](managing-office-365-endpoints.md) guide to understand how best to use the information here. Except for emergency changes, endpoints are updated at the end of each month. 
  
 **Important:** Destination endpoints may be listed as an IP addresses only, FQDN/URI only, or a combination of the two. Office 365 depends on internet based services such as Microsoft-owned cloud services with dynamic addressing, Domain Name System (DNS), Content Delivery Networks (CDN), Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL), and other third-party services where no IP addresses are available. Where IP or FQDN information is not available, we've marked them as **Not Available (N/A)** in the tables below.
