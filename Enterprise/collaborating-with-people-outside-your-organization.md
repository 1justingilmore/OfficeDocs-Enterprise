# Collaborating with people outside your organization

By default, in Microsoft 365, guest sharing is enabled for SharePoint and OneDrive, but disabled for Teams. Many SharePoint and OneDrive guest sharing scenarios work without further configuration. To confirm the settings for a scenario that you're using, or enable a new one, choose from the following options:

- [Collaborate on documents](collaborate-on-documents.md) - Learn how to configure Microsoft 365 to allow sharing and collaboration with guests on files and folders.
- [Collaborate in a site](collaborate-in-a-site.md) - Learn how to configure Microsoft 365 to enable sharing SharePoint sites with guests.
- [Collaborate as a team](collaborate-as-a-team.md) - Learn how to configure Microsoft 365 to enable guest collaboration in Teams.
