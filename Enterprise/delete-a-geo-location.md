# Delete a geo location in OneDrive for Business Multi-Geo

If you no longer need a geo location, you can delete it from your tenant from the [OneDrive admin center](https://admin.onedrive.com)

> [!WARNING]
> All user data in the geo location will be permanently deleted. This includes all OneDrive for Business content, SharePoint sites, and Group sites. You must migrate any data to another location before you delete the location. This action cannot be undone.

Only global administrators can delete geo locations.

1. Open the [OneDrive admin center](https://admin.onedrive.com)

2. Navigate to the **Geo locations** tab.

3. On the map, click the geo location that you want to delete.

4. Click **Delete location**.

5. Confirm the deletion by selecting the confirmation check boxes.

6. Click **Delete**.
