# Azure integration with Office 365

Office 365 uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)to manage user identities behind the scenes. Your Office 365 subscription includes a free subscription to Azure AD so that you can integrate Office 365 with Azure AD if you want to sync passwords or set up single sign-on with your on-premises environment. You can also buy advanced features to better manage your accounts.
  
Azure also offers other functionality, like managing integrated apps, that you can use to extend and customize your Office 365 subscriptions.
  
You can also use the Azure AD advisors: the [Azure AD Connect advisor](https://aka.ms/aadconnectpwsync), the [AD FS deployment advisor](https://aka.ms/adfsguidance), the [Azure RMS Deploymnet Wizard](https://aka.ms/azuremsguidance), and the [Azure AD Premium setup guide](https://aka.ms/aadpguidance).
  
## Azure AD editions and Office 365 identity management

If you have a paid subscription to Office 365, you also have a free subscription to Azure AD. You can use Azure AD to create and manage user and group accounts. To activate this subscription you have to complete a one-time registration. Afterward, you can access Azure AD from your Office 365 admin portal. For instructions, see [register your free Azure AD subscription](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617127). 
  
> [!TIP]
> Follow the instructions above to register the free Azure AD subscription that comes with your subscription to Office 365. Don't go directly to Azure.Microsoft.com to sign up or you'll end up with a trial or paid subscription to Microsoft Azure that is separate from your free one for Office 365. 
  
With the free subscription you can synchronize with on-premises directories, set up single sign-on, and synchronize with many software as service applications, such as Salesforce, DropBox and many more.
  
If you want enhanced AD DS functionality, bi-directional synchronization, and other management capabilities, you can upgrade your free subscription to a paid premium subscription. For details see [Azure Active Directory editions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=524280).
