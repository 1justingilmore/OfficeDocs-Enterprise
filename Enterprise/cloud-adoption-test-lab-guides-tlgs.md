# Test Office 365 with cloud adoption Test Lab Guides (TLGs)

 **Summary:** Use these cloud adoption Test Lab Guides (TLGs) to set up demonstration, proof of concept, or dev/test environments for Office 365.
  
TLGs help you quickly learn about Microsoft products. They're great for situations where you need to evaluate a technology or configuration before you decide whether it's right for you and before you begin the design, planning, and rollout to users. The "I built it out myself and it works" hands-on experience helps you understand the deployment requirements of a new product or solution so you can better plan for hosting it in production.
  
TLGs also create representative environments for development and testing of applications, also known as dev/test environments.

## Office 365 dev/test environment

Use these articles to build your Office 365 dev/test environment:
  
- [Base Configuration dev/test environment](base-configuration-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Create a simplified intranet running in Microsoft Azure infrastructure services. This is an optional step if you want to build a simulated enterprise configuration.
    
- [Office 365 dev/test environment](office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Create an Office 365 Enterprise E5 trial subscription, which you can do from your computer or from a simplified intranet running in Azure infrastructure services.
    
- [DirSync for your Office 365 dev/test environment](dirsync-for-your-office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Install and configure Azure AD Connect for directory synchronization with password hash synchronization. This is an optional step if you want to build a simulated enterprise configuration.
    
For your Office 365 dev/test environment, use these articles to demonstrate enterprise features of Office 365:
  
- [Multi-factor authentication for your Office 365 dev/test environment](multi-factor-authentication-for-your-office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Configure and test secondary authentication using a text message sent to your smart phone for an account in your Office 365 subscription.
    
- [Federated identity for your Office 365 dev/test environment](federated-identity-for-your-office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Configure and demonstrate federated authentication with the accounts of an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain.
    
- [Advanced Threat Protection for your Office 365 dev/test environment](advanced-threat-protection-for-your-office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Configure and demonstrate Advanced Threat Protection, which is a feature of Exchange Online Protection (EOP) that helps keep malware out of your email.
    
- [Advanced eDiscovery for your Office 365 dev/test environment](advanced-ediscovery-for-your-office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Add example data and demonstrate Advanced eDiscovery, which lets you quickly find and analyze the data that is stored in Office 365, including email and documents.
    
- [Sensitive file protection in the Office 365 dev/test environment](sensitive-file-protection-in-the-office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Demonstrate how you can use Office 365 Information Rights Management to protect the data in sensitive documents, even when they are accidentally posted in the wrong document folders.
    
- [Data classification and labeling in the Office 365 dev/test environment](data-classification-and-labeling-in-the-office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Demonstrate how the Azure Information Protection client can be used to classify documents with various levels of security.
    
- [Isolated SharePoint Online team site dev/test environment](isolated-sharepoint-online-team-site-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Demonstrate how to create a SharePoint Online team site that is isolated from the rest of the organization for sensitive or highly confidential resources.
    

## Simulated cross-premises dev/test environments

You can create a cross-premises dev/test environment, which includes an Azure virtual network and a simulated on-premises network, with these articles:
  
- [Simulated cross-premises virtual network in Azure](simulated-cross-premises-virtual-network-in-azure.md)
    
    Create a simulated intranet connected to an Azure virtual network in a hybrid cloud configuration.
    
- [Intranet SharePoint Server 2016 in Azure dev/test environment](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt806351%28v=office.16%29.aspx)
    
    Create a single-server SharePoint Server 2016 farm in the Azure virtual network and test connectivity and administration from the simulated on-premises network.
    
## SharePoint Server 2016 dev/test environments

Here are SharePoint Server 2016 dev/test environments that you can create in Azure infrastructure services:
  
- [SharePoint Server 2016 dev/test environment in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/SharePoint/administration/sharepoint-server-2016-dev-test-environment-in-azure)
    
    Build a single-server SharePoint Server 2016 farm in Azure infrastructure services.

- [Intranet SharePoint Server 2016 in Azure dev/test environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/SharePoint/administration/intranet-sharepoint-server-2016-in-azure-dev-test-environment)
    
    Build a single-server SharePoint Server 2016 farm in Azure infrastructure services and access it from a simulated intranet.


## The Microsoft 365 Enterprise dev/test environments

Create dev/test environment for [Microsoft 365 Enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-enterprise/) with [these articles](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/m365-enterprise-test-lab-guides).
